        p
          | It’s no secret that Facebook 
          a(href='http://time.com/money/5212501/how-facebook-tracks-me/') knows a lot about you
          | : some users share their entire lives on the social media platform, from where they are going to lunch, to what they’re currently thinking. Everything you do on the site is tracked, analyzed, and categorized in order to build a highly intricate model of your digital existence. And the “why?” is no secret either — in 2017 Facebook made almost 
          a(href='https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2018/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2017-Results/default.aspx') 98.3 percent of its revenue from digital advertisements
          | . Facebook is a great platform to stay connected with others, yes, but it’s also the perfect platform for marketers to promote highly targeted advertisements in order to maximize reach, brand awareness, and click-through-rates. Facebook is a classic example of “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.”
        p
          | Facebook is rather transparent, actually, in disclosing what 
          a(href='https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences')
            | “influences the ads you see and [how you can] take control over your ad experience,”
          |  all of which are available on your ad preferences page. There is one particular metric, however, that is particularly intriguing: your “US Politics.” Discourse around politics and, more specifically, your political ideology used to be rather culturally taboo; discretion around your political leanings was “normal” if not understood. While in recent years, this has become less of a reality, there are many Americans who elect to consciously keep their voting and political views private.
        p
          | So how does Facebook know about your “US Politics”? Good question. A 2016 New York Times article entitled “Liberal, Moderate or Conservative? See How Facebook Labels You” reports the following:
        blockquote(cite='https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/us/politics/facebook-ads-politics.html')
          p
            | Facebook makes a deduction about your political views based on the pages that you like — or on your political preference, if you stated one, on your profile page. If you like the page for Hillary Clinton, Facebook might categorize you as a liberal.
          p
            | Even if you do not like any candidates’ pages, if most of the people who like the same pages that you do — such as Ben and Jerry’s ice cream — identify as liberal, then Facebook might classify you as one, too.

          | Facebook uses machine learning and incredibly complex algorithms in order to predict, analyze, and score behavior. These algorithms influence everything you see on the platform, from suggested pages to follow, the types of advertisements you see, to the order of your News Feed.
        p
          | To the average person, this concept might be interesting or — maybe — somewhat scary. To a student of social science, this idea is fascinating: when else, in the history of the world, has political ideology been determined by subconscious bias and engagement at this scale? Never.
        p
          | Using this political data, Facebook has served as an important agent in the construction and propagation of echo chambers. Constant exposure to content that we agree with and believe manifests in further political polarization, and trains our brains to become more resistant to opposing viewpoints. It’s hard to see and experiment with this concept in an interactive way in the real world on Facebook, though.

          | As visitors to the site engage with articles in various ways, we will attempt to classify their political bias based upon the kinds of articles they react positively to and the strength in which they engage with such posts. Different combinations of liking, commenting, or sharing will yield in an Engagement Value value from 0 to ±9. Thus, we need to find a way to use that value to determine how far “left” (liberal, in the negative direction) or “right” (conservative, in the positive direction) they should move on the political spectrum and assign the user an Alignment Value in the range (-1, 1). A major requirement is that, should they continue reacting to articles of one alignment infinitely, they will never be classified as completely liberal (less than -1) or completely conservative (greater than +1).

              | Engagement Values should be weighted more heavily when they appear in a pattern; if your engagement history tells us that you more frequently and heavily interact with conservative articles, then engaging with another “conservative” article shouldn’t be that surprising and should push you closer to 1 at a lesser rate.
        h4#av-formula Formula

          | As combining engagement values without wanting to surpass a limit (-1 or 1) clearly implies an infinite series, the following formula was derived from a P-series consisting of an infinite sum of fractional values:
