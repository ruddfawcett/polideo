          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Welcome to <em>Polideo</em>, a platform where you can visually see what impact your <b>likes</b>, <b>comments</b>, and <b>shares</b> on Facebook could have on your perceived political ideology.</p>
          <p>Think of this site as a sort of Facebook algorithm simulation. As per <a href='#methodology'>our methodology below</a>, <em>Polideo</em> uses a super simple algorithm to score your political ideology based upon your interactions with anonymous Facebook posts. </p>
          <p><b>Like</b>, <b>comment</b>, <b>share</b>, or <b>ignore</b> the post below to get started.</p>

        <p>As visitors to the site engage with articles in various ways, we will attempt to classify their political bias based upon the kinds of articles they react positively to and the strength in which they engage with such posts. Different combinations of liking, commenting, or sharing will yield in an Engagement Value value from 0 to ±9. Thus, we need to find a way to use that value to determine how far “left” (liberal, in the negative direction) or “right” (conservative, in the positive direction) they should move on the political spectrum and assign the user an Alignment Value in the range (-1, 1). A major requirement is that, should they continue reacting to articles of one alignment infinitely, they will never be classified as completely liberal (less than -1) or completely conservative (greater than +1).</p>
        <h4>Formula Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>User’s Alignment Value must remain within the range of (-1, 1).</p></li>
          <li><p>Engagement Values should be weighted more heavily when they appear in a pattern; if your engagement history tells us that you more frequently and heavily interact with conservative articles, then engaging with another “conservative” article shouldn’t be that surprising and should push you closer to 1 at a lesser rate.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Formula</h4>
        <p>As combining engagement values without wanting to surpass a limit (-1 or 1) clearly implies an infinite series, the following formula was derived from a P-series consisting of an infinite sum of fractional values:</p>
        <div class='mathjax'>
          \[
            f_{AV}(IA, \ EV,\ AV_{n-1}) = AV_{n-1} \ + \
            \begin{cases}
             (\frac{EV}{5})((1-|AV|)^2) & \text{if } |EV+AV| \geq |AV| \\
           - (\frac{EV}{5})((1-|AV|)^2) & \text{if } |EV+AV| < |AV|
            \end{cases}
          \]
